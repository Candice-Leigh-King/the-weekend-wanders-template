      <p><strong>WELCOME!</strong>&nbsp;We're Tara and Brittany and our journey
      began with a <strong>shared passion for travel and a desire to create a
      space where LGBTQ individuals could find inspiration</strong>, guidance,
      and a sense of belonging in their wanderlust pursuits. Drawing from our
      own experiences as queer travelers, we <strong>embarked on a mission to
      uncover hidden gems, celebrate diverse cultures, and showcase
      LGBTQ-friendly destinations around the globe.</strong></p><p>What sets us
      apart is not just our love for adventure, but our unwavering dedication to
      amplifying <strong>LGBTQ voices in the travel industry. </strong>We
      recognize the importance of representation, as LGBTQ travelers still face
      challenges and barriers. We strive to highlight the experiences of LGBTQ
      travelers, from navigating unfamiliar terrains to <strong>finding
      welcoming spaces in every corner of the world.</strong> <em>From
      destination guides, travel tips, to collaborating with LGBTQ-owned
      businesses,</em> our platform serves as a beacon of empowerment for queer
      travelers everywhere.</p><p>Weekends are sacred to us, reserved for
      embarking on spontaneous road trips, exploring nearby cities, or immersing
      ourselves in the natural wonders of the great outdoors. Whether it's
      hiking through scenic trails, camping under the stars, or indulging in
      local cuisine, <strong>we approach each adventure with
      joy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We have a dog, Remy, who comes on our adventures
      when possible. <strong>We &nbsp;are committed to our mission of making the
      world a more inclusive and welcoming place for LGBTQ travelers.</strong>
      With each adventure, we redefine what it means to <strong>travel
      authentically,</strong> <em>fearlessly,</em> and <u>unapologetically</u>
      as members of the queer community.</p><p>We're so glad you're here and
      can't wait to connect more with you!</p><p><strong>-Tara and
      Brittany</strong></p>

        In the age of social media, it's all about reaching a larger audience
        and getting in front of an audience you may not have tapped into yet! 

        Images with a subject help potential guests picture themselves there &
        actually perform 30% better than

        posts without a subject!

        We have a strong connection in multiple communities that can help boost
        your brand and/or place! 

        Let's work on building a mutually beneficial relationship for both our
        audiences.
